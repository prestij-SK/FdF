# FdF
42 school project (Fil de Fer)


This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.
FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe model’.

The project is not fully over yet, it can draw and give results, but it's not perfect yet.
